2. then (tripod multiplier)
3. floor the number
4. then(rune multiplier)
5. floor the number
6. then (enlightenment bracelet multiplier, if applicable)
7. floor the number
8. then(spec multiplier) + (engraving multiplier like PS which is additive to spec multiplier, if applicable)
9. spec multiplier is defined by (spec)*(class spec scaling)/6.99
10. floor the number
11. but you have to do it for **every individual hit for multiple hits** you need to calculate *every hit separately* with the above‚Äù
